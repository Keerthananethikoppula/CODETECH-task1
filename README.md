Project Overview:
The goal of this project is to develop a simple calculator program using Python. This calculator will allow users to perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Key Activities:
 * User Input:
   * Prompt the user to enter two numbers.
   * Prompt the user to choose an operation from the given options.
 * Input Validation:
   * Check if the entered numbers are valid (e.g., not strings or empty values).
   * Ensure the chosen operation is among the supported ones.
 * Operation Selection:
   * Based on the user's input, select the appropriate operation to perform.
 * Calculation:
   * Perform the selected operation on the two numbers.
 * Result Display:
   * Display the calculated result to the user in a clear and informative manner.
technoligies used: 
 1. Python: The task explicitly asks for a "Python program," indicating that Python is the intended programming language for this project.
 2. Text-based Input/Output: The program will likely use Python's built-in functions like input() to get user input (numbers and operation choice) and print() to display the result.
 3. Basic Arithmetic Operations: The program will utilize Python's arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /) to perform the calculations.  In essence, the task involves using Python's core language features for basic input, output, and arithmeticÂ operations.
